# Building My Portfolio with Astro

Creating a portfolio website is always an exciting project. This time, I decided to use Astro, a modern static site generator that focuses on performance and developer experience.

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro for several reasons:

1. **Performance First**: Astro generates static HTML by default, which means incredibly fast loading times
2. **Component Islands**: I can use interactive components only where needed, keeping the site lightweight
3. **TypeScript Support**: Built-in TypeScript support makes development more reliable
4. **Modern DX**: Great developer experience with hot reloading and excellent tooling

## What I've Built

The portfolio includes:

- **Hero Section**: Personal introduction with a circular photo frame
- **Projects Showcase**: Reusable components for displaying my work
- **Blog System**: Markdown-based blog with proper layouts and styling
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on all devices

## Technical Highlights

Some interesting technical decisions I made:

- **Component-based Architecture**: Created reusable components like `ProjectPage` for consistency
- **Asset Optimization**: Proper image importing for production builds
- **Analytics Integration**: Vercel Analytics for tracking visitor insights
- **Modern CSS**: Custom properties and smooth animations

Building this portfolio has been a great learning experience, and Astro has made the development process enjoyable and efficient.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
